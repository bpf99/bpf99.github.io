# My Battletabs Profile

Battletabs is a multiplayer online web3 game like battleship where the goal is to sink your opponent's ships before they sink yours. The twist is, each ship has a special ability and each can change the game completely. There's a ton of strategy and I highly recommend trying it out.

- moderator of the [official discord server](https://discord.gg/battletabs)
  - longest active player and discord member 
  - also help with game balancing
