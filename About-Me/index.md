# I'm bpf99. 

Discord doesn't give enough room for an about me so here's the most basic github.
I'm (not currently) available from 8 AM PST to 9 PM PST on weekdays except for holidays

If you're from the BT server trying to get more info, I'm taking a break for a while. I have a ton of stuff to deal with irl, and don't have the time or energy to do really do anything BT related right now.

If you know me in real life and actually are reading this you probably know that I've been off lately. I'm really sorry if it's affected you and text me if you want as best an excuse as I can give for being so bleh lately.

I go by bpf99 or bpf
