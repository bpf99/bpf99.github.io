# Pokémon

I'm a pretty casual Pokémon player, but want to get a bit more competitive. 

Favorite mons:
1. Umbreon
2. Espeon
3. Oshawott

On [Pokémon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com), I'm not that great, but I'm working on my teambuilding and want to be competent at some point.

I play Random Battles, Nat Dex, and OU.

Don't ping me or DM me for tips, as I'm not that good at competitive battling. If you want [Battletabs](https://bpf99.github.io/Battletabs) tips though, I'm your guy.
