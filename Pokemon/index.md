# Pokémon

I'm a pretty casual Pokémon player, but want to get a bit more competitive. 

Favorite mons:
1. Umbreon
2. Espeon
3. Oshawott

On [Pokémon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com), I'm not that great, but I'm working on my teambuilding and want to be competent before gen 9 releases.

I play Monotype, UU, LC, AG, and some OU.
