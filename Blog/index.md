I'm very busy IRL so I won't update this frequently.

Over 13 years ago (in case you're wondering if I'm violating Discord TOS): I was born

11/14/21 My best friend died. Very suddenly. That's why the bottom half of my Discord about me is there.

11/21/22 Watching the world cup with my friend. A bunch of relatives came over and I'm not feeling great, hopefully this is just allergies and I'm not sick.

11/22/22 Still not feeling good, and I have a four year old cousin to babysit.
