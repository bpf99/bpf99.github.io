I'm very busy IRL so I won't update this frequently.

Over 13 years ago (in case you're wondering if I'm violating Discord TOS): I was born

11/14/21 My best friend died. Very suddenly. That's why the bottom half of my Discord about me is there.

11/21 Watching the world cup with my friend. A bunch of relatives came over and I'm not feeling great, hopefully this is just allergies and I'm not sick.

11/22 Still not feeling good, and I have a four year old cousin to babysit.

11/23 Yep I'm sick. Great way to spend Thanksgiving break. I have so much work to get done too.

11/24 Happy Thanksgiving? I feel horrible today. I'm just stuck in my room, and I don't know if I can hang out with my friends coming over today. I gues the bright side is that I can get some work done without needing to entertain my cousin.

11/25 Everyone left. Thank God. Still sick though, and not getting any work done.

11/26 I can't believe it's the weekend. My break's already gone. Have so much work to catch up on.

11/28 Back on the grind. Got a project done yesterday which is nice but still have a couple essays to write, and some digital art stuff to do.

11/29 I like can't focus on my work I keep getting distracted. BT 3D came out today and I'm organizing the invitational tournament too. It doesn't help that I'm not able to stay up that late, either.

11/30 Had a history test today, it sucked like always. The multiple choice questions always get me.

12/2 KOREA WON THEIR MATCH!!! and god i still have so much work to do
